Overview of each code

"AskTheGirls" is a personal website I created usint HTML/CSS

"SotMachine" is the build of a Unity slot machine game I coded with C#

"Builds" is a game called Boulder Breaker which was created with Unity Engine and Visual Studio C#
          I had to remove the third level because the file was too large to put on GitHub
          The game is a 2D platformer with 3 different enemies attacking throughout the levels
          
"SarahJohnson" is a character creator where you create name and assign skill points to your character 
          and you can save your character to a text file for later as well as load the character back 
          from the text file
